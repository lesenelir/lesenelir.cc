Hi, I am Lesenelir Zhou, a dedicated web developer. I majored in computer science for both my BSc and MSc.
However, I had never been interested in programming before, until I began to explore the field of web development.

For me at present, programming is more than just a skill; it has become a means of self-expression that fulfills my desire for creativity.
All of my projects and demos, along with their <a href="https://github.com/lesenelir">GitHub</a> repositories and some online pages,
can be accessed on the <a href="/projects">Projects page</a>.

At the same time, I am also interested in web3 & crypto. Additionally, I will write down my thoughts and insights in Chinese on Mirror.
You can find me on Mirror by <a href="https://mirror.xyz/lesenelir.eth">Lesenelir.eth</a>.

Apart from programming, I enjoy movies and photography. Perhaps one day, I will become a filmmaker or a photographer.
